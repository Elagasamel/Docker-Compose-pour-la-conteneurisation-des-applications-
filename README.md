# Interacting with Containers and Using Docker Compose for Application Containerization

#### The term **“Docker”** refers to several things:  
the Open Source community project, the tools created from this project, the company **Docker Inc.** which is the main supporter of the project, and the tools officially maintained by the company.

Here is a brief explanation of this ecosystem:

- **Docker software** is a containerization technology that enables the creation and use of Linux containers.
- The **Docker Open Source community** works to improve this technology, which is freely available to everyone.
- **Docker Inc.** builds upon the work of the Docker community, secures the technology, and shares its improvements with all users. It then provides support for these enhanced and secured technologies for enterprise customers.

#### With Docker technology, containers can be treated as **lightweight and modular virtual machines**.  
These containers offer great flexibility: they can be created, deployed, copied, and moved from one environment to another, allowing applications to be optimized for **cloud environments**.
